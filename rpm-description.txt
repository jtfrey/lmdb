The lmdb library and tools is used to perform periodic checks of license usage on FLEXlm license servers and store the data in:

  - a SQLite3 database file

  - an round-robin database (RRD) file

The former format allows for rich queries against the data using SQL, while the latter allows graphs to easily be generated from the data.
